Banksy Synchronization Model

The Banksy Equation system is a network model defined by a set of nonlinear equations governing the evolution of state variables (e.g. phases $\theta_i$) in time. It emphasizes synchronization dynamics: individual units (oscillators) adjust their state based on differences with a global reference and with neighbors, leading to collective phase alignment. The model includes control-like parameters and energy measures that drive the system toward coherent behavior. 

The Banksy Equation System – Dynamics and Structure
The Banksy model consists of $N$ coupled units each with a phase $\theta_i(t)$ at time $t$, along with a global phase-like variable $S(t)$ and an output $Y(t)$. The system is defined by iterative update equations (discrete-time dynamics). A core variable is the phase difference $\tilde{\theta}_i(t) = S(t) - \theta_i(t)$, i.e. how far unit $i$ lags or leads the global reference $S$. The update for each unit’s phase is:

θi(t+1)=θi(t)+Aisin(θ~i(t))+αgθ~i(t)+αk[Kθ(t)]i,

where $A_i$ is a coupling amplitude for unit $i$, $\alpha_g$ and $\alpha_k$ are gain parameters, and $[K,\theta(t)]_i$ denotes the $i$th component of $K,\theta(t)$ (with $K$ a coupling matrix, akin to a connectivity matrix). This equation has multiple terms: (1) a sine coupling $A_i\sin(\tilde{\theta}_i)$ which is a typical phase synchronization term driving $\theta_i$ toward reducing the phase difference, (2) a linear term $\alpha_g \tilde{\theta}_i$ which acts like a proportional feedback forcing $\theta_i$ to track $S(t)$ (this term tends to eliminate constant offsets), and (3) a network coupling term $\alpha_k (K\theta)_i$ representing input from other oscillators (e.g. if $K$ encodes connections or an adjacency matrix). This structure is reminiscent of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators extended with additional linear and network coupling: the Kuramoto model uses $\dot{\theta}i = \omega_i + \sum_j K{ij}\sin(\theta_j-\theta_i)$, which in discrete form is similar to a $\sin$ difference term​.  Indeed, sinusoidal phase coupling is a canonical mechanism to achieve synchronization in a network of oscillators​.  Here, the Banksy model augments it with linear feedback ($\alpha_g$) and network connectivity ($\alpha_k$), giving it richer dynamics and the ability to tune how strongly each unit responds to global vs. local discrepancies.

The global phase $S(t)$ is updated as well, which is unusual in standard oscillator models (often a static order parameter is defined but not dynamically updated). In Banksy,

S(t+1)=S(t)+Lexternomtanh(N1j=1∑NAjsin(θj(t)−S(t))),

where $L_{\text{externom}}$ is a gain for the external feedback. This equation means the reference $S$ shifts over time based on the average phase mismatch of all oscillators relative to $S$. The term inside $\tanh$ is $\frac{1}{N}\sum_j A_j\sin(\theta_j - S)$, essentially the average sine of phase differences. If the oscillators are mostly lagging behind $S$, this sum is positive and $S$ will decrease (since $\theta_j - S$ is negative, $\sin$ is negative, check signs carefully), and if they are ahead, $S$ increases – in effect, $S$ is pulled toward the average phase of the population. The hyperbolic tangent $\tanh(\cdot)$ serves as a saturating nonlinearity, preventing $S$ from updating too aggressively when the mismatch is large. This S-update equation can be viewed as a control law that tries to entrain the global phase $S$ to the oscillator ensemble: it will converge when $S$ is such that the average $\sin(\theta_j - S)=0$, i.e. $S$ aligns in a way that oscillators are equally distributed around it or synchronized with it. This mechanism is analogous to a consensus algorithm or an adaptive frequency synchronization in control theory – $S$ acts like a pacemaker that itself adapts to minimize the global phase error. The inclusion of $\tanh$ makes the update resemble a sigmoidal control response, ensuring stability by bounding $S(t+1)-S(t)$. Such adaptive coupling of a global variable is in line with adaptive networks studied in synchronization literature, where global or coupling parameters adjust based on network state to reach synchrony.

The Banksy model also defines an output:

Y(t+1)=tanh(Jθ(t+1))+λQCSσ(ΦUθ(t+1)).

Here $\theta(t+1)$ represents the vector of all unit phases at time $t+1$. The output $Y$ combines two components: a $\tanh(J\theta)$ term, which is like a standard neural network output (applying a weight matrix $J$ to the state and passing through $\tanh$ activation), and a second term $\lambda Q_{CS},\sigma(\Phi U \theta)$, which involves a logistic sigmoid $\sigma$ acting on another linear projection $\Phi U \theta$. In essence, $Y$ is a readout of the oscillator states, mixing a hyperbolic tangent nonlinearity and a sigmoid nonlinearity. The coefficient $\lambda Q_{CS}$ scales the second component; $Q_{CS}$ might indicate a particular projection (e.g. a “control signal” or a “classifier signal” – it’s not fully specified here). This structure suggests $Y$ could represent a prediction or control output influenced by the synchronized state of the system. For example, if we interpret $\Phi U \theta$ as some classification or gating unit (with $\sigma$ giving a probability-like output), and $J$ as a linear readout, $Y$ combines a continuous estimate with a categorical-like signal. In any case, $Y(t)$ is driven by the collective state $\theta(t)$, meaning the Banksy oscillator network doesn’t just synchronize internally but also produces an output that could interface with an external task (for instance, $Y$ could feed into a larger neural system or control loop). Finally, the Banksy equations define an energy-like quantity for each oscillator and a measure of overall synchronization effectiveness. For each unit $i$:

Ei(t)=21(Aisin(θ~i(t))+αgθ~i(t)+αk[Kθ(t)]i)2+(1−cos(θ~i(t))).

This $E_i(t)$ has two parts: a kinetic-like term (the square of the phase update “force”) and a potential-like term $1-\cos(\tilde{\theta}_i)$. Notably, $1-\cos(\phi)$ is minimal (0) when $\phi=0$ and increases for larger phase differences – it’s the classic phase synchronization energy used in physics (it appears in the Josephson junction energy and in phase oscillator Lyapunov functions, being essentially $2\sin^2(\phi/2)$). Thus, $E_i$ is low when oscillator $i$ is closely synchronized with $S$ (small $\tilde{\theta}_i$ and small update forcing). If $E_i$ is high, it means $i$ either has a large phase error or is experiencing a strong forcing term (i.e. not in equilibrium). The model then defines an effective synchronized count:

Neff(t)=i=1∑Nσ(ΔEi(t)−E0),

where $\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ is the logistic function, $E_0$ a reference energy threshold, and $\Delta$ a scale. This essentially counts how many oscillators have energy above (or below) a certain threshold $E_0$ in a smooth way. If $E_i$ is well below $E_0$, $\sigma((E_i-E_0)/\Delta)\approx 0$; if well above, $\sigma\approx 1$. So $N_{\text{eff}}$ might represent the number of oscillators that are effectively active or out-of-sync. For example, if $E_0$ is set to a value representing “minimally unsynchronized”, then $N_{\text{eff}}$ would be high if many oscillators have not yet synchronized (high phase error), and near 0 if most are synchronized (low $E_i$). In that sense, $N_{\text{eff}}$ could serve as an order parameter indicating the degree of synchronization (lower is more synchronized). The use of a sigmoid makes it differentiable and gradually changing rather than a sharp count.

In summary, the Banksy system is a nonlinear dynamical network combining: (a) Oscillator phases with sinusoidal coupling (promoting phase locking) and linear/global feedback (ensuring convergence and stability), (b) a global variable $S$ that adaptively tunes to the group (like an adjustable central phase or an external forcing that itself learns from the group – a form of closed-loop control in the network), (c) a defined energy function $E_i$ per oscillator and a global measure $N_{\text{eff}}$ that reflects the system’s synchronized state (hints of an underlying Lyapunov function or at least a performance metric for synchronization), and (d) an output $Y$ that reads the state into a form that could interface with computing or control tasks. The presence of explicit energy terms and saturating activations ($\tanh$, $\sigma$) in the equations suggests the model may be designed to converge to energy-minimizing synchronized states, akin to h.  y a Lyapunov function (global energy) that decreases each update​. This is reminiscent of how Hopfield networks (which we discuss later) converge by minimizing an energy function for neural activations​.  Here, each update to $\theta_i$ and $S$ presumably reduces phase mismatches, lowering the $1-\cos$ term and the squared term in $E_i$. The logistic count $N_{\text{eff}}$ increasing or decreasing over time could indicate how the system approaches an ordered synchronized phase. Thus, the Banksy system marries synchronization (like a Kuramoto-style phase alignment) with concepts of energy minimization and even neural-network-like output computation.


Energy and Objective: Energy and Landscape. basin of attraction

Time Scale and Convergence:    If the Banksy model was extended to have an outer loop (for example, if we also slowly tuned $A_i$ or $\alpha_g$ over time instead of keeping them fixed), that outer loop would be analogous to evolution. In some adaptive oscillator research, they do have adaptive coupling strengths (plastic weights) that change slowly based on activity (e.g. via a Hebbian rule or gradient of a global energy)​:  LINK:  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19417-9#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20prominent%20plasticity,In%20PD%2C%20the%20desirable ,   If one applied an STDP rule to a network of phase oscillators, the couplings would strengthen between synchronized ones, potentially leading to cluster formation.  This is similar to an EA or gradient process reinforcing connections that lead to lower energy. So the notion of learning rule appears: Banksy doesn’t explicitly have weights changing (besides the global $S$ which is like a special weight), but one could imagine a learning rule for $K$ or $A_i$ (like $A_i$ adapting if oscillator $i$ consistently lags, etc.). In neural nets, the learning rule is backprop or evolutionary selection. Both are means to an end of improving coordination – either coordination among oscillators or alignment of network parameters with data structure.


In summary, the Banksy model’s dynamics are those of a coupled nonlinear oscillator system reaching synchronization, whereas the E-SSL model’s dynamics are those of a coupled nonlinear optimization system reaching a learned configuration. The control parameters in Banksy (coupling strengths $A_i$, feedback gains $\alpha_{g}, \alpha_{k}, L_{\text{ext}}$, etc.) determine how quickly and stably sync is achieved. In E-SSL, the control parameters (architecture choices, hyperparameters, EA settings) determine how effectively and efficiently the network learns good representations. Both have to balance stability vs. adaptability: too high coupling or learning rate can cause oscillations (literal oscillations in one, weight divergence in the other), too low and they converge slowly or get stuck. Both benefit from some form of nonlinearity to handle saturation – Banksy uses $\sin$ and $\tanh$, neural nets use activation functions that are often saturating (sigmoid, ReLU saturates on one side, etc.), which help limit explosive behavior and introduce complexity for richer dynamics.




Learning Rules and Adaptation: The Banksy model doesn’t explicitly present a learning rule (no equation changes its parameters based on performance during the simulation – parameters are fixed during one run). However, one could consider how one tunes those parameters in designing the model. That tuning could be done by an outer algorithm – and here is a tie-in: you could use an evolutionary algorithm to evolve the parameters ${A_i, \alpha_g, \alpha_k, L_{\text{externom}}, J, \lambda, Q_{CS}, \Phi U, E_0, \Delta}$ of the Banksy model to achieve certain behavior. That would literally combine the two frameworks: an EA optimizing a synchronization network. Conversely, the neural model does have a learning rule (backprop or similar) for weights – which is essentially a form of adaptation based on error gradients. That is algorithmically different from how oscillators adapt (which in Banksy is via a fixed rule built into the dynamics), but conceptually it serves a similar role: reduce error. Hebbian learning (“fire together, wire together”) is a rule that increases connection weight if neuron $i$ and $j$ activate synchronously. If we applied Hebbian learning to an oscillator network, when two oscillators lock phase, we’d increase their coupling. This could further strengthen synchrony (positive feedback) or in some designs could be balanced with a constraint to saturate at a certain coupling. Interestingly, if $K$ in Banksy became time-dependent $K(t)$ with such a rule, the network would self-tune connectivity to reinforce synchrony, potentially speeding up or solidifying the phase locking. This is analogous to how a neural network practice a pattern and the synapses strengthen, making that pattern of neural co-firing more stable in the future (like learning an attractor in a Hopfield net). In the study of adaptive Kuramoto networks, researchers have indeed combined phase update equations with slow weight updates (learning rules) and found the emergence of multi-cluster synchronization and enhanced coherence​.

For example, one rule is $ \dot{K}{ij} = \epsilon(\cos(\phi{ij}) - K_{ij}) $ meaning the coupling increases if phase difference is small (in phase) and decays otherwise​.  This leads to a network that learns to permanently synchronize certain pairs of oscillators. That’s very much like a network learning a pattern.
