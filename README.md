# BANKSY Project

This repository contains resources and research materials for the BANKSY (Brain-inspired Adaptive Neural Knowledge Synchronization) project.

## Repository Structure

The main files are organized in the following directories:

- `banksy_files/`: Main directory containing organized research materials
  - `Adaptive Timing and Phase Gating Mechanisms/`: Research on neural timing and phase gating
    - `ctc/`: Communication Through Coherence materials
    - `DNC/`: Differentiable Neural Computer research

## About This Repository

This repository contains research papers, implementation notes, and documentation related to neural synchronization models, oscillatory networks, and adaptive timing mechanisms.

The repository is structured to organize materials by research area and topic, with PDF papers and markdown documentation files included.
